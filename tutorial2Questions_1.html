                <li>What are inline styles, embedded styles, and external style sheets? Which
                    would you use to define a design for an entire web site?</li>
                <li>What keyword do you add to a style property to override style precedence and
                    style inheritance?</li>
                <li>Provide the code to enter the style comment “Tri and Succeed Sports Color
                    Styles“.</li>
                <li>Provide the style rule to display block quote text in red using an RGB triplet.</li>
                <li>The color chartreuse is located at 90° on the color wheel with 100% saturation
                    and 50% lightness. Provide a style rule to display address text in black with
                    chartreuse as the background color.</li>
                <li>What is progressive enhancement?</li>
                <li>
                    Based on the following style rule for paragraph text, which style property will
                    be used by an older browser that supports only CSS2?
                    p { color: rgb(232, 121, 50); color: (hsl23, 80%, 55%, 0.75); }    
                </li>
                <li>Provide a style rule to display h1 and h2 headings with a background color of
                    yellow (an equal mixture of red and green at highest intensity with no blue) at
                    70% opacity.</li>
            </ol>

            <h3>Question 1</h3>
            <p>Inline styles are style rules written as attributes inside an element. Due to this, 
                the style rule only applies to a single element.</p>
            <p>Embedded styles are style rules written inside the head of an HTML document using the 
                "style" tag. These rules will only apply to the document it is written in.</p>
            <p>External style sheets are style rules written inside a CSS file and then linked to the HTML 
                document. External style sheets can be applied to many different web pages which allows
                the programmer to make changes to many web pages by editing a single CSS file.

            <h3>Question 4</h3>
            <p>blockquote {
                color: red;
            }
            </p>
            <p>
                <blockquote>
                    The blockquote tag specifies a section that is quoted from another source.
                </blockquote>
            </p>

            <h3>Question 5</h3>
            <p>address {
                color: black;
                background-color: hsl(90, 100%, 50%);
            }
            </p>
            <address>123 Yard Fish Drive, <br />Imagine City<br /> GG 567443</address>

            <h3>Question 6</h3>
            <p>Progressive enhancement is the process of writing code from older versions of a 
                programming language before code from more recent versions. Consequently,
                the older code is used by the web browser first and the newer code is used last.
                This allows older browsers to still run the files properly but also allows browsers that support more recent
                versions of the language to implement the newer standards and techniques. 
                
            </p>

            <h3>Question 7</h3>
            <p>The older browser would use the color displayed by the rgb(232, 121, 50) color value because the rgb
                color value is supported by older versions of CSS whereas the hsl color value comes from more recent
                versions of CSS and would not be supported by older browsers. Furthermore, the older rgb value is written 
                before the hsl value and therefore takes advantage of progressive enhancement.
            </p>

            <h3>Question 8</h3>
            <p>
                h1, h2 {
                    background-color: rgba(ff, ff, 00, 0.70);
                } 
            </p>
